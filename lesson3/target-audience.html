        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <img class="persona-img" src="images/jeff-davis.jpg" alt="Jeff Davis" width="200" height="250">
        <p>Jeff Davis is the 73 year-old owner of a large ranch a few miles outside of town. The ranch has been in his family for 
            generations, and he's worked on it full-time since he graduated high school. With no wife or children, his main focus 
            in using the site now is to find information about events so he can socialize and network. He isn't too comfortable 
            with computers, mostly using his home desktop once or twice a week for emails, but the site's layout is simple enough 
            that he can handle it without any problems.
        </p>
        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <img class="persona-img" src="images/debra-clark.jpg" alt="Debra Clark" width="200" height="250">
        <p>Debra Clark is a 37 year-old who owns a small family restaurant with her husband. Since she has a business degree, she 
            takes the role of manager while he works from home and takes care of their children. Her main goal using the site is 
            to promote her business and connect with other business owners. She mostly accesses the site with her phone since 
            she's rarely at home, and is much more focused on networking through messaging and calls since she doesn't normally 
            have time for group events.
        </p>
        <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p>A local business owner has questions about the chamber, and can't find the exact information he wants on the site. He 
            heads to the Contact page and is able to leave a comment with his question, as well as find contact information for 
            the chamber officers so he can reach out to them.
        </p>
        <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p>A town resident has family coming to visit and isn't sure what sights there are to show them. She looks up the Discover 
            page and finds some events in town and historical sites to see.
        </p>
        <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p>A restaurant owner in town wants to network with a local grocer in order to improve supply. By going to the Directory 
            page, she finds a list of grocers she can connect with.
        </p>
        <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p>A business owner in town is curious about joining the chamber, but doesn't know if it'll be worth it for him. On the 
            Join page he finds information about benefits and membership levels so he can make an informed decision.
        </p>
        <h3>Scenario</h3>
        <p>A chamber member is heading to an event, but can't remember where it's supposed to be. The website's mobile-friendly 
            design makes it easy for him to look up the event and its location on his phone while he's out and about.
